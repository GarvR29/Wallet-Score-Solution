Wallet Score Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the credit scores assigned to wallets interacting with the Aave V2 protocol, based on their historical transaction behavior. The scores range from 0 to 1000, with higher scores indicating more reliable and responsible usage.

1. Score Distribution
The distribution of wallet credit scores across various ranges is as follows:

Score Range  	Number of Wallets

0-100	        12

101-200	      44

201-300	      145

301-400	      2451

401-500	      726

501-600      	106

601-700	      7

701-800	      3

801-900	      2

901-1000	    0

Observations:

The majority of wallets fall within the 301-400 score range, suggesting a large group of users with moderate risk profiles or typical usage patterns.

There's a significant drop-off in the number of wallets as scores increase beyond 500, indicating that highly reliable and responsible users are fewer.

The highest score achieved in this sample is 893.15, with no wallets reaching the 901-1000 range, which suggests that achieving a perfect or near-perfect score is challenging based on the current scoring model and data.

A notable number of wallets are in the lower ranges (0-300), which will be further analyzed below.

2. Behavior of Wallets in the Lower Range (0-300)
Wallets in the lower credit score ranges typically exhibit behaviors indicative of higher risk, less responsible engagement, or potentially exploitative patterns.

Example Wallets (from output):

0x037343879ca2c1d0078038549ee042046f32243f (Score: 0.00)

0x0230b6df83cc33bcf9c7c29ace1ae5078fe36b74 (Score: 6.70)

0x04426a58fdd02eb166b7c1a84ef390c4987ae1e0 (Score: 9.73)

Common Characteristics of Low-Scoring Wallets:

Presence of liquidation_flag = 1: This is a strong indicator of risky behavior. All the bottom 5 wallets show a liquidation_flag of 1, meaning they have experienced at least one liquidation call. This suggests a failure to manage collateral effectively, leading to significant penalties in the score.

High borrow_to_repay_ratio: Many low-scoring wallets, especially those with liquidations, tend to have very high borrow_to_repay_ratio (often capped at 10.0 in our model). This implies they borrow significantly more than they repay, or have very minimal repayments relative to their borrowings, signaling potential default risk.

Lower repay_count relative to borrow_count: While they might have some deposits, their repayment activity is often insufficient to offset their borrowing, leading to an unfavorable ratio.

Moderate total_deposit_usd with high risk: Interestingly, some low-scoring wallets might have a non-trivial total_deposit_usd (e.g., 0x037343879ca2c1d0078038549ee042046f32243f has 1.00E+23 USD in deposits). However, this is overshadowed by their risky borrowing and liquidation history, demonstrating that large deposits alone don't guarantee a high score if risk management is poor.

3. Behavior of Wallets in the Higher Range (700-1000)
Wallets achieving higher credit scores demonstrate characteristics of responsible, stable, and value-adding interactions with the Aave V2 protocol.

Example Wallets (from output):

0x02eca8cc78b7d30c1ac5e16988ed2c8a9da658d6 (Score: 1000.00)

0x0034baeeb160a5f1032b6d124d3e87cc94d74e62 (Score: 893.15)

0x058b10cbe1872ad139b00326686ee8ccef274c58 (Score: 835.33)

Common Characteristics of High-Scoring Wallets:

Absence of liquidation_flag = 0: High-scoring wallets consistently show no history of liquidation calls, indicating excellent collateral management and risk mitigation.

High total_deposit_usd: These wallets typically make substantial deposits, contributing significantly to the protocol's liquidity. The top 5 wallets show very high total_deposit_usd values (e.g., 3.01E+25 USD).

High repay_count: They demonstrate consistent and numerous repayment actions, reflecting responsible debt management.

Low borrow_to_repay_ratio: While some may borrow, their borrow_to_repay_ratio is either low or near 1.0 (indicating that borrowings are largely offset by repayments). The top wallets show ratios like 1.84, 1.00, or 1.04, signifying that even with borrowing, they maintain healthy repayment practices.

Positive net_flow_usd (not explicitly shown but implied by high deposits): These wallets are net contributors of capital to the protocol.

Potentially longer activity_duration_days and stable avg_daily_transactions (not directly in sample output but important): Indicative of long-term engagement rather than short, speculative bursts of activity.
